 * Binary day/night was not enough once the scene became ambient: a clear afternoon and a
 * clear 6pm are the same weather but a completely different colour, and running the day
 * palette until the sun physically sets made every evening look wrong.
 *
 * Derived from the local clock rather than from real sunrise/sunset tables. The error is at
 * most an hour or so seasonally, which is invisible in a background wash — and it costs no
 * network call, no location fix, and no extra dependency.
