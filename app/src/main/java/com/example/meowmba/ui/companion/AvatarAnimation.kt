 * Avatar animation framework (Phase 1 foundation).
 *
 * This file is the scalable core of the avatar system described in the Memba
 * architecture: a state-machine-driven controller that maps the single
 * observable [CompanionState] into a declarative [AvatarPose], plus a named
 * [CatAnimationRegistry] so future animation clips (the 100+ expressions and
 * cat actions from the roadmap) can be registered and resolved by name
 * instead of being hardcoded in the renderer.
 *
 * Everything here is pure Kotlin (no Compose imports) so the animation logic
 * is unit-testable on the JVM and never coupled to a model provider,
 * speech engine, or rendering toolkit.
