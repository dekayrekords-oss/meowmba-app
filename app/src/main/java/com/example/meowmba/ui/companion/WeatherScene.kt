/**
 * Atmospheric weather drawn behind the companion.
 *
 * The first version of this looked cheap for concrete reasons, all of which are addressed
 * here rather than papered over:
 *
 *  - **Real blur.** Three stacked canvases at 26dp / 10dp / 0dp. minSdk is 31, so
 *    [Modifier.blur] is a GPU RenderEffect. Soft falloff is most of what makes weather
 *    look like weather; the previous version had none and every edge was hard and aliased.
 *  - **Depth.** Far elements are large, slow, dim and heavily blurred; near ones are
 *    smaller, faster, brighter and sharp. One flat layer at one speed reads as a
 *    screensaver.
 *  - **Soft particles.** Radial-gradient sprites and gradient-stroked streaks with round
 *    caps, instead of hard-edged circles and 1.8px lines.
 *  - **Real shapes.** Clouds are multi-lobe [Path]s, not three overlapping ovals.
 *  - **No blobs in the air.** Fog and dust are *bands*, never ovals. Drawing haze as a
 *    radial-gradient oval reads as a circle no matter how soft the falloff is, and once
 *    you see the circles you cannot unsee them. Both are now edgeless full-width sheets
 *    whose horizontal texture comes from a mirrored, drifting gradient — there is no shape
 *    boundary anywhere on screen to notice.
 *  - **Wind.** A bounded lateral offset pushes particles sideways, so motion is not a dead
 *    straight line. It is added, never multiplied into the accumulating position — doing
 *    that made the rain travel UPWARDS whenever the gust fell faster than the clock rose.
 *  - **Time of day.** The sky is tinted by [TimeOfDay], not by a day/night boolean, and the
 *    sun sits low and warm at dawn and dusk. Ambient mode leaves this running all day, so
 *    "it is 6pm" has to be visible or the scene stops matching the window.
