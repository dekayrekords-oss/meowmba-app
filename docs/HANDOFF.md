## What this app is
MEOWMBA (`com.example.meowmba`) is an on-device cat-companion voice assistant:
wake word ("hey meow" + variants), Silero VAD + speaker-verification gates,
on-device ASR/TTS, an agent runtime with tools, animated avatar, memory (Room +
markdown vault), desktop/LAN/USB bridge for computer control, and optional
native image generation. Kotlin + Jetpack Compose, minSdk 31, NDK 27, arm64 only.

## Working copies (keep them converged)
- PRIMARY (edit here): `/Users/bobrossjr/AndroidStudioProjects/Meowmba`
- origin: bare repo on `meow-nb:/home/claude/git/meowmba-app.git`
- remote worktree: `meow-nb:/home/claude/meowmba-app` (has JDK 21 + Android SDK, can build)
- local mirror: `~/meowmba-app`
- Device: Galaxy Z Fold 6 (SM-F966U1, serial RFCY61NJEVM); USB drops — fix with
  `adb kill-server && adb start-server`.

## Build & release
- Auto-build: `.git/hooks/post-commit` → `scripts/autobuild.sh` builds debug AND
  release APKs to `build-out/meowmba-{debug,release}-<sha>.apk` and notifies macOS.
- Release signing: `keystore.properties` + `meowmba-release.keystore` (gitignored,
  chmod 600). Release APK signature differs from debug — uninstall before switching.
- All native libs are built 16KB page-aligned (required by Android 15).
- Model assets (KWS/VAD/speaker) are gitignored; regenerate with
  `scripts/fetch_kws_assets.sh` on a fresh checkout before installing on device.

## Known quirks / pre-existing issues
- `ModelDownloadViewModelTest`: 3 JVM-only failures (unmocked android.content.Intent).
  Known since before the voice fixes; not a device problem. Everything else is green.
- Cleartext HTTP allowed app-wide for user-typed LAN endpoints (documented in
  `network_security_config.xml`); all fixed endpoints are HTTPS.
- `MeowmbaRuntimeService` is exported but double-gated: package allowlist AND
  same-signing-certificate check (fails closed).
- Cloud backup excludes database/sharedpref/files domains (privacy).

## Feature map (where things live)
- Voice pipeline: `core/audio/` (WakeWordService, SherpaKws, VadGate+WindowCarry,
  SpeakerVerifier). Wake variants: `KwsKeywords.kt` (authoritative; tokens must
  exist in the model vocab or they silently never fire).
- Agent: `core/agent/` (OmniRoute routing, runtime/, tools/). Providers: Ollama,
  OpenAI, BigPickle/OpenCode, on-device (LiteRt/MediaPipe/GeminiNano).
- Desktop control: `core/bridge/` + daemon `bridge/meowmba-bridge.py`.
- Memory: Room (`messages`, `memories`, `memories_fts`, `audit_log`) +
  `core/vault/` markdown notes (Obsidian-compatible, filesDir/vault).
- Animations: `ui/companion/CustomAnimation.kt` (BUILT_INS + invented clips,
  MIN_VISIBLE_MS=1200 stretch, smoothstep, clamps) + `IdleAnimationDirector`.
- Backgrounds: `core/background/BackgroundPrefs.kt` enum + `ui/companion/AnimatedBackgrounds.kt`.
- Settings persistence: `core/security/SecureStorageManager.kt`
  (saveBooleanPreference/getBooleanPreference for toggles; API keys encrypted).

## Tools window vs Agents window
Same screen. Both tiles open `AgentsScreen.kt` (roster, active tasks, tool list
with risk levels, audit trail).

## Recent builds
## Phase B features (2026-08-04)

- **BigPickle brain**: OpenCode Zen key in Settings → route `bigpickle`
  (https://opencode.ai/zen/v1, model `big-pickle`). "Default brain" selector
  forces one provider (others dropped except the always-kept on-device
  fallback). Route table rebuilds on Settings save (`rebuildOmniRoute`).
- **Ask-anything recall**: `messages_fts` FTS4 index (Room v5, data-preserving
  MIGRATION_4_5 + LIKE fallback). `memory.recall` tool searches chat history +
  memories + vault notes. Completed agent tasks are journaled into the vault
  ("Task log: …", appended, never overwritten).
- **SSH management**: Settings → Servers stores encrypted hosts; `ssh.run`
  tool runs allowlisted read-only commands only (ls/df/free/uptime/systemctl
  status/journalctl tail/docker ps), rejects shell metacharacters, TOFU host
  keys, 4KB output cap, 30s timeout. jsch = com.github.mwiede:jsch:0.2.21.
